mhood112: Without using any external libraries or importing,Write a function that alphabetically sorts the names of the TV shows and then creates ordered sets with the name of the show, genres, language, and rating, and writes to a new CSV file. Keep in mind that there are some commas and quotes within this dataset.



GitHub Copilot: To achieve this, we need to:

1. Read the CSV data.
2. Parse the data to extract the required fields.
3. Sort the TV shows alphabetically by their names.
4. Create ordered sets with the name of the show, genres, language, and rating.
5. Write the ordered sets to a new CSV file.

Here's the function to do that:

```python
def sort_tv_shows_and_write_to_csv(input_csv, output_csv):
    # Read the CSV data
    with open(input_csv, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Extract the header and data rows
    header = lines[0].strip().split(',')
    data = lines[1:]

    # Parse the data to extract the required fields
    tv_shows = []
    for line in data:
        fields = line.strip().split(',')
        name = fields[0]
        genres = fields[5]
        language = fields[7]
        rating = fields[9]
        tv_shows.append((name, genres, language, rating))

    # Sort the TV shows alphabetically by their names
    tv_shows.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Write the ordered sets to a new CSV file
    with open(output_csv, 'w') as file:
        file.write('Name,Genres,Language,Rating\n')
        for show in tv_shows:
            file.write(f'{show[0]},{show[1]},{show[2]},{show[3]}\n')

# Usage
sort_tv_shows_and_write_to_csv('TV_Show copy.csv', 'sorted_tv_shows.csv')
```

This function reads the input CSV file, extracts the necessary fields, sorts the TV shows by their names, and writes the sorted data to a new CSV file. Note that this function assumes the input CSV file is formatted correctly and does not handle any potential errors or edge cases.

mhood112: make sure that the extra quotes and commas are handled within the data

GitHub Copilot: To handle extra quotes and commas within the data, we need to properly parse the CSV file. We can achieve this by implementing a custom CSV parser that respects quoted fields.

Here's the updated function:

```python
def sort_tv_shows_and_write_to_csv(input_csv, output_csv):
    def parse_csv_line(line):
        fields = []
        field = ''
        in_quotes = False
        for char in line:
            if char == '"' and not in_quotes:
                in_quotes = True
            elif char == '"' and in_quotes:
                in_quotes = False
            elif char == ',' and not in_quotes:
                fields.append(field)
                field = ''
            else:
                field += char
        fields.append(field)
        return fields

    # Read the CSV data
    with open(input_csv, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Extract the header and data rows
    header = lines[0].strip().split(',')
    data = lines[1:]

    # Parse the data to extract the required fields
    tv_shows = []
    for line in data:
        fields = parse_csv_line(line.strip())
        name = fields[0]
        genres = fields[5]
        language = fields[7]
        rating = fields[9]
        tv_shows.append((name, genres, language, rating))

    # Sort the TV shows alphabetically by their names
    tv_shows.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Write the ordered sets to a new CSV file
    with open(output_csv, 'w') as file:
        file.write('Name,Genres,Language,Rating\n')
        for show in tv_shows:
            file.write(f'"{show[0]}","{show[1]}","{show[2]}","{show[3]}"\n')

# Usage
sort_tv_shows_and_write_to_csv('TV_Show.csv', 'sorted_tv_shows.csv')
```

This function includes a `parse_csv_line` helper function to correctly handle quoted fields and commas within the data. The output CSV file will also have fields enclosed in quotes to preserve any commas within the data.

mhood112: Why is the new csv not being created

GitHub Copilot: There could be several reasons why the new CSV file is not being created. Here are a few things to check:

1. **File Path**: Ensure that the file paths provided for both the input and output CSV files are correct.
2. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read the input file and write to the output file.
3. **Exceptions**: Check if there are any exceptions being raised during the execution of the function.

Let's add some error handling and logging to help diagnose the issue:

```python
def sort_tv_shows_and_write_to_csv(input_csv, output_csv):
    def parse_csv_line(line):
        fields = []
        field = ''
        in_quotes = False
        for char in line:
            if char == '"' and not in_quotes:
                in_quotes = True
            elif char == '"' and in_quotes:
                in_quotes = False
            elif char == ',' and not in_quotes:
                fields.append(field)
                field = ''
            else:
                field += char
        fields.append(field)
        return fields

    try:
        # Read the CSV data
        with open(input_csv, 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()

        # Extract the header and data rows
        header = lines[0].strip().split(',')
        data = lines[1:]

        # Parse the data to extract the required fields
        tv_shows = []
        for line in data:
            fields = parse_csv_line(line.strip())
            name = fields[0]
            genres = fields[5]
            language = fields[7]
            rating = fields[9]
            tv_shows.append((name, genres, language, rating))

        # Sort the TV shows alphabetically by their names
        tv_shows.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        # Write the ordered sets to a new CSV file
        with open(output_csv, 'w') as file:
            file.write('Name,Genres,Language,Rating\n')
            for show in tv_shows:
                file.write(f'"{show[0]}","{show[1]}","{show[2]}","{show[3]}"\n')

        print(f"CSV file '{output_csv}' created successfully.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Usage
sort_tv_shows_and_write_to_csv('TV_Show.csv', 'sorted_tv_shows.csv')
```

This code includes a try-except block to catch any exceptions that might occur during the execution of the function. It also prints a success message if the CSV file is created successfully. This should help you diagnose why the new CSV file is not being created.

mhood112: Add some error handling

GitHub Copilot: To add error handling, we can include checks for file existence, permissions, and potential issues during parsing and writing. Here's the updated code with enhanced error handling:

```python
def sort_tv_shows_and_write_to_csv(input_csv, output_csv):
    def parse_csv_line(line):
        fields = []
        field = ''
        in_quotes = False
        for char in line:
            if char == '"' and not in_quotes:
                in_quotes = True
            elif char == '"' and in_quotes:
                in_quotes = False
            elif char == ',' and not in_quotes:
                fields.append(field)
                field = ''
            else:
                field += char
        fields.append(field)
        return fields

    try:
        # Read the CSV data
        with open(input_csv, 'r') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()

        if not lines:
            raise ValueError("The input CSV file is empty.")

        # Extract the header and data rows
        header = lines[0].strip().split(',')
        data = lines[1:]

        # Parse the data to extract the required fields
        tv_shows = []
        for line in data:
            fields = parse_csv_line(line.strip())
            if len(fields) < 10:
                raise ValueError("The input CSV file has an incorrect format.")
            name = fields[0]
            genres = fields[5]
            language = fields[7]
            rating = fields[9]
            tv_shows.append((name, genres, language, rating))

        # Sort the TV shows alphabetically by their names
        tv_shows.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        # Write the ordered sets to a new CSV file
        with open(output_csv, 'w') as file:
            file.write('Name,Genres,Language,Rating\n')
            for show in tv_shows:
                file.write(f'"{show[0]}","{show[1]}","{show[2]}","{show[3]}"\n')

        print(f"CSV file '{output_csv}' created successfully.")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{input_csv}' does not exist.")
    except PermissionError:
        print(f"Error: Permission denied when accessing the file '{input_csv}' or '{output_csv}'.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Usage
sort_tv_shows_and_write_to_csv('TV_Show.csv', 'sorted_tv_shows.csv')
```

This code includes:
- A check to ensure the input file is not empty.
- A check to ensure the input file has the correct format.
- Handling for `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`.
- A general exception handler to catch any other errors that might occur.
