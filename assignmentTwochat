mhood112: Without using local libraries or imports, using data from a csv file, find the most common day for shows to be scheduled

GitHub Copilot: To find the most common day for shows to be scheduled without using any local libraries or imports, you can manually read the CSV file and process the data. Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. **Read the CSV file**: Open the file and read its contents line by line.
2. **Extract the days**: Extract the column that contains the days when shows are scheduled.
3. **Count the occurrences**: Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each day.
4. **Find the most common day**: Determine which day has the highest count.

Here is the code to achieve this:

```python
def find_most_common_day(csv_file_path):
    day_counts = {}
    
    with open(csv_file_path, mode='r') as file:
        # Read the header line to find the index of the 'day' column
        header = file.readline().strip().split(',')
        day_index = header.index('day')
        
        # Read the rest of the lines
        for line in file:
            row = line.strip().split(',')
            day = row[day_index]
            
            if day in day_counts:
                day_counts[day] += 1
            else:
                day_counts[day] = 1
    
    # Find the most common day
    most_common_day = max(day_counts, key=day_counts.get)
    return most_common_day

# Example usage
csv_file_path = 'shows_schedule.csv'  # Replace with your actual CSV file path
most_common_day = find_most_common_day(csv_file_path)
print(f"The most common day for shows to be scheduled is: {most_common_day}")
```

Make sure your CSV file has a column named `day` that contains the days when shows are scheduled. Adjust the column name in the code if it is different.
