mhood112: Without using any external libraries or inputing, Write a function that orders TV show names based on their run time (based on length of time between Premiere Date and End Date) and as a set to a new CSV file. Keep in mind that there are additional quotes and comma within this data



GitHub Copilot: To achieve this, we need to:

1. Parse the CSV data.
2. Calculate the runtime for each TV show.
3. Sort the TV shows based on their runtime.
4. Write the sorted TV show names to a new CSV file.

Here is a Python function to accomplish this:

```python
import csv
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_runtime(premiere_date, end_date):
    if not end_date:
        return 0
    premiere = datetime.strptime(premiere_date, "%m/%d/%y")
    end = datetime.strptime(end_date, "%m/%d/%y")
    return (end - premiere).days

def order_tv_shows_by_runtime(input_file, output_file):
    tv_shows = []

    with open(input_file, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            runtime = calculate_runtime(row['Premiere Date'], row['End Date'])
            tv_shows.append((row['Name'], runtime))

    # Sort TV shows by runtime
    tv_shows.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Write sorted TV show names to a new CSV file
    with open(output_file, mode='w', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(['Name'])
        for show in tv_shows:
            writer.writerow([show[0]])

# Example usage
order_tv_shows_by_runtime('TV_Show.csv', 'Sorted_TV_Shows.csv')
```

This function reads the TV show data from 

TV_Show.csv

, calculates the runtime for each show, sorts the shows by runtime, and writes the sorted show names to `Sorted_TV_Shows.csv`.

GitHub Copilot: Here is a Python function that processes the CSV data, calculates the runtime for each TV show, sorts the shows based on their runtime, and writes the sorted show names to a new CSV file. This function does not use any external libraries or imports:

```python
def calculate_runtime(premiere_date, end_date):
    if not end_date:
        return 0
    premiere_month, premiere_day, premiere_year = map(int, premiere_date.split('/'))
    end_month, end_day, end_year = map(int, end_date.split('/'))
    premiere_days = premiere_year * 365 + premiere_month * 30 + premiere_day
    end_days = end_year * 365 + end_month * 30 + end_day
    return end_days - premiere_days

def order_tv_shows_by_runtime(input_file, output_file):

    with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        headers = lines[0].strip().split(',')
        name_index = headers.index('Name')
        premiere_index = headers.index('Premiere Date')
        end_index = headers.index('End Date')

        for line in lines[1:]:

            runtime = calculate_runtime(premiere_date, end_date)
            tv_shows.append((name, runtime))

    # Sort TV shows by runtime
    tv_shows.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Write sorted TV show names to a new CSV file
    with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write('Name\n')
        for show in tv_shows:
            file.write(f'{show[0]}\n')

# Example usage
order_tv_shows_by_runtime('TV_Show.csv', 'Sorted_TV_Shows.csv')
```

This function reads the TV show data from 

TV_Show.csv

, calculates the runtime for each show, sorts the shows by runtime, and writes the sorted show names to `Sorted_TV_Shows.csv`. The `calculate_runtime` function converts the dates to a simple day count for comparison.

mhood112: what is this error

GitHub Copilot: The error in your code likely arises from the way the CSV lines are being split. The 

strip().split(',')

 method does not handle cases where there are commas within quoted fields correctly. This can lead to incorrect splitting of the columns.

To fix this, you need to handle quoted fields properly. Here is an updated version of your code that addresses this issue:

```python
def calculate_runtime(premiere_date, end_date):
    if not end_date:
        return 0
    premiere_month, premiere_day, premiere_year = map(int, premiere_date.split('/'))
    end_month, end_day, end_year = map(int, end_date.split('/'))
    premiere_days = premiere_year * 365 + premiere_month * 30 + premiere_day
    end_days = end_year * 365 + end_month * 30 + end_day
    return end_days - premiere_days

def parse_csv_line(line):
    in_quotes = False
    field = ''
    fields = []
    for char in line:
        if char == '"' and not in_quotes:
            in_quotes = True
        elif char == '"' and in_quotes:
            in_quotes = False
        elif char == ',' and not in_quotes:
            fields.append(field)
            field = ''
        else:
            field += char
    fields.append(field)
    return fields

def order_tv_shows_by_runtime(input_file, output_file):
    tv_shows = []

    with open(input_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        headers = parse_csv_line(lines[0].strip())
        name_index = headers.index('Name')
        premiere_index = headers.index('Premiere Date')
        end_index = headers.index('End Date')

        for line in lines[1:]:
            columns = parse_csv_line(line.strip())
            name = columns[name_index].strip('"')
            premiere_date = columns[premiere_index].strip('"')
            end_date = columns[end_index].strip('"')
            runtime = calculate_runtime(premiere_date, end_date)
            tv_shows.append((name, runtime))

    # Sort TV shows by runtime
    tv_shows.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    # Write sorted TV show names to a new CSV file
    with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        file.write('Name\n')
        for show in tv_shows:
            file.write(f'{show[0]}\n')

# Example usage
order_tv_shows_by_runtime('TV_Show.csv', 'Sorted_TV_Shows.csv')
```

This code includes a `parse_csv_line` function that correctly handles quoted fields and commas within those fields. This should resolve any issues related to incorrect splitting of the CSV lines.

mhood112: Add in some error handling

GitHub Copilot: Here is the updated code with added error handling to manage potential issues such as missing or malformed dates, missing columns, and file read/write errors:

```python
def calculate_runtime(premiere_date, end_date):
    try:

        premiere_days = premiere_year * 365 + premiere_month * 30 + premiere_day
        end_days = end_year * 365 + end_month * 30 + end_day
        return end_days - premiere_days
    except ValueError:
        return 0

def parse_csv_line(line):
    in_quotes = False
    field = ''
    fields = []
    for char in line:
        if char == '"' and not in_quotes:
            in_quotes = True

            name_index = headers.index('Name')
            premiere_index = headers.index('Premiere Date')
            end_index = headers.index('End Date')

                    end_date = columns[end_index].strip('"')
                    runtime = calculate_runtime(premiere_date, end_date)
                    tv_shows.append((name, runtime))
                except IndexError:
                    print(f"Skipping malformed line: {line.strip()}")

        # Sort TV shows by runtime
        tv_shows.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

        # Write sorted TV show names to a new CSV file

            file.write('Name\n')
            for show in tv_shows:
                file.write(f'{show[0]}\n')

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file {input_file} was not found.")
    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: An I/O error occurred while processing the file {input_file}.")

# Example usage
order_tv_shows_by_runtime('TV_Show.csv', 'Sorted_TV_Shows.csv')
```

In this updated code:
- The 

calculate_runtime

 function includes a `try-except` block to handle potential `ValueError` exceptions when parsing dates.
- The 

order_tv_shows_by_runtime

 function includes error handling for file operations (`FileNotFoundError` and `IOError`).
- Each line is processed within a `try-except` block to handle potential `IndexError` exceptions when accessing columns, and malformed lines are skipped with a message printed to the console.

mhood112: Explain this code in simple terms

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a simple explanation of the code:

1. **calculate_runtime Function**:
   - This function calculates the number of days between the premiere date and the end date of a TV show.
   - It splits the dates into month, day, and year parts.
   - It converts these parts into a total number of days for easy comparison.
   - If there's an error in the date format, it returns 0.

2. **parse_csv_line Function**:
   - This function reads a line from a CSV file and splits it into individual fields.
   - It handles cases where fields are enclosed in quotes and may contain commas.
   - It returns a list of fields.

3. **order_tv_shows_by_runtime Function**:
   - This function reads TV show data from a CSV file, calculates the runtime for each show, and sorts the shows by runtime.
   - It opens the input file and reads all lines.
   - It uses 

parse_csv_line

 to split the header line and find the indexes of relevant columns (Name, Premiere Date, End Date).
   - For each subsequent line, it extracts the relevant data, calculates the runtime, and stores it in a list.
   - It sorts the list of TV shows by runtime in descending order.
   - It writes the sorted TV show names to a new CSV file.

The code includes error handling to manage potential issues with date parsing and file operations.
