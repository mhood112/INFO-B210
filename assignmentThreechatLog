mhood112: Without importing libraries, using repeated execution, find which tv show has the most number of seasons and which show has the most number of episodes

GitHub Copilot: To find the TV show with the most number of seasons and the one with the most number of episodes without importing libraries, you can manually iterate through the data and keep track of the counts. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Open the CSV file and read its contents.
2. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum number of seasons and episodes.
3. Iterate through each line of the CSV file.
4. For each line, extract the number of seasons and episodes.
5. Update the tracking variables if the current line has more seasons or episodes than the previously recorded maximum.
6. Print the results.

Here is the code to achieve this:

```python
# Open the CSV file
with open('Tv_Show1.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Skip the header line
    next(file)
    
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the maximums
    max_seasons = 0
    max_episodes = 0
    show_with_max_seasons = ""
    show_with_max_episodes = ""
    
    # Iterate through each line in the file
    for line in file:
        # Split the line by comma to extract fields
        fields = line.strip().split(',')
        
        # Extract the show name, number of seasons, and number of episodes
        show_name = fields[0]
        num_seasons = int(fields[1])
        num_episodes = int(fields[2])
        
        # Update the maximum seasons and episodes if necessary
        if num_seasons > max_seasons:
            max_seasons = num_seasons
            show_with_max_seasons = show_name
        
        if num_episodes > max_episodes:
            max_episodes = num_episodes
            show_with_max_episodes = show_name

# Print the results
print(f"Show with the most seasons: {show_with_max_seasons} ({max_seasons} seasons)")
print(f"Show with the most episodes: {show_with_max_episodes} ({max_episodes} episodes)")
```

This code will read the CSV file, process each line to find the TV show with the most seasons and the one with the most episodes, and then print the results.

mhood112: Without importing libraries, using while loops, find which tv show has the most number of seasons and which show has the most number of episodes

GitHub Copilot: To achieve this using `while` loops instead of [`for`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fmiahood%2FDownloads%2FRepeated%20Execution%2FrepeatedExe.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%5D%2C%2208be50a2-15d1-4cbb-b5af-15a8b632364f%22%5D "Go to definition") loops, you can manually iterate through the lines of the file. Here is the updated code:

```python
# Open the CSV file
file = open('Tv_Show1.csv', 'r')

# Skip the header line
file.readline()

# Initialize variables to keep track of the maximums
max_seasons = 0
max_episodes = 0
show_with_max_seasons = ""
show_with_max_episodes = ""

# Read the first line of the file
line = file.readline()

# Iterate through each line in the file using a while loop
while line:
    # Split the line by comma to extract fields
    fields = line.strip().split(',')
    
    # Extract the show name, number of seasons, and number of episodes
    show_name = fields[0]
    num_seasons = int(fields[1])
    num_episodes = int(fields[2])
    
    # Update the maximum seasons and episodes if necessary
    if num_seasons > max_seasons:
        max_seasons = num_seasons
        show_with_max_seasons = show_name
    
    if num_episodes > max_episodes:
        max_episodes = num_episodes
        show_with_max_episodes = show_name
    
    # Read the next line of the file
    line = file.readline()

# Close the file
file.close()

# Print the results
print(f"Show with the most seasons: {show_with_max_seasons} ({max_seasons} seasons)")
print(f"Show with the most episodes: {show_with_max_episodes} ({max_episodes} episodes)")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Open the File**:
    ```python
    file = open('Tv_Show1.csv', 'r')
    ```

2. **Skip the Header Line**:
    ```python
    file.readline()
    ```

3. **Initialize Variables**:
    ```python
    max_seasons = 0
    max_episodes = 0
    show_with_max_seasons = ""
    show_with_max_episodes = ""
    ```

4. **Read the First Line**:
    ```python
    line = file.readline()
    ```

5. **While Loop to Iterate Through Lines**:
    ```python
    while line:
        fields = line.strip().split(',')
        show_name = fields[0]
        num_seasons = int(fields[1])
        num_episodes = int(fields[2])
        
        if num_seasons > max_seasons:
            max_seasons = num_seasons
            show_with_max_seasons = show_name
        
        if num_episodes > max_episodes:
            max_episodes = num_episodes
            show_with_max_episodes = show_name
        
        line = file.readline()
    ```

6. **Close the File**:
    ```python
    file.close()
    ```

7. **Print the Results**:
    ```python
    print(f"Show with the most seasons: {show_with_max_seasons} ({max_seasons} seasons)")
    print(f"Show with the most episodes: {show_with_max_episodes} ({max_episodes} episodes)")
    ```

This code uses a `while` loop to read each line of the file, process the data, and update the maximum values accordingly.
