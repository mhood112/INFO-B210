## **variablesAndoperators.py**
  ### In this file, I was tasked with making a code that will identify how many of the columns in my dataset, contain string values.
    

## **conditionalExecution.py**
  ### The purpose of this purpose is to count the most common day for the shows to be scheduled.;
    * This program will take in the data from the csv and read it. 
    * To use this program, the user will need to download the csv file and the code file. The user will need to make sure that csv file and the code file are in the same folder. 

## **repeatedExecution**
  ### The purpose of this is to find which TV show has the most number of seasons and which show has the most number of episodes?

  
## **BuiltInFunction.py**
  ### The purpose of this is to ask the user for a network and then prints the titles of all the shows that are available on that network from this list.
    * This will take that input and go through each individual row to see what show is with the inputed network
    * Use the Tv_Show.csv as the CSV file

## **UserDefinedFunction.py**
  ### **The purpose is to ask the user for a genre and print out most common Schedule(time) based upon genre inputed.
    * Use the Tv_Show.csv as the CSV file
    * This is suppose to take the csv file and read the data. Then it will know that column 6 is where the genre data is located, and column 12 is where the schedule(time) data is located. It will go throw those columns and put the genres into a dictionary, while keeping track of the schedule(times) to see which one was used the most for that said genre. This should print out all the genres with the corresponding common time. I know that is not what will get displayed. In the dataset, the summary column has an abundance amount of commas, so when the data is being split by the commas, it will include those commas as well ruining the columns.
